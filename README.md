# Python Data Sandox

Python Data Sandbox lets you analyse common data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML...) using Python, on your own computer, without installing anything.

You get all the power of Python, none of the setup complications, and your data never leaves your machine.

This might be of interest if you are:

* A **data analyst** needing a flexible, easily-accessible environment for ad-hoc analysis.
* A **business user** wanting to explore and manipulate data independently without procuring complex tools. 

Possible uses might include:

* Data Profiling: Building lightweight tools for automated data profiling to assess data quality, identify anomalies, and understand data distributions.
* Data Lineage and Impact Analysis: Building specialised tools to map data lineage, track data transformations, and perform impact analysis for changes.
* Privacy Compliance: Creating utilities for anonymisation, pseudonymisation, and data masking to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
* Governance Automation: Developing scripts for automating governance tasks such as data validation, policy enforcement, and compliance monitoring.
* Bias Detection: Integrate bias detection libraries into data pipelines to identify and mitigate biases in machine learning models.
